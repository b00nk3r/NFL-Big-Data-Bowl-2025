    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Pre-snap movemnts in football are utilized by offense team to to confuse the opponent and reveal their defensive strategies. However, the potential of the insight that defense team can get from the pre-snap movements of the opponent is still underestimated. These movements can reveal some attacking patterns, and help the defense be more prepared for them. This project, in particular, is focused on predicting the running routes of the players that perform pre-snap motion based on their movement trajectory.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main tool used to implement this project is clustering of pre-snap motions. There are thousands of pre-snap motions in our dataset, and since the idea of the project is to make a prediction based on the pre-snap motion of the opponent team, we need to be able to differentiate these motions from each other. That's why we will perform clustering to sparate all the movements into catefories. Then we will look at the distribution of routes ran within each cluster to get the insights about them.\n",
    "\n",
    "The reasons why route ran was chosen as the offensive behaviour to predict are not really unique for this metric only. This just seems as somrthing that can benefit defensive team in preparing for games and provide some useful insights about the offense. But the main part of the project is movements clustering. After we split them into categories, we will be able to look at different metrics within cluster and make some predictions. So you can think of route ran just as of example to illustrate our approach.\n",

    "# Data preprocessing\n",
    "\n",
    "We are focused on the pre-snap movements in the first 9 weeks of the season. Since we are clustering attacking movements, we will focus only on the datapoints that correspond to the possession team. For consistnecy, we will also make all the plays' directions same and adjust the coordinates based on the ball position. This will ensure that similar trajectories in the different regions of the field are treated similarly. Finally, we will leave only the players that were in motion at the moment of the snap, and we will leave only situations where there was just one player at motion. All the code for data preprocessing can be found **<a href=\"https://github.com/b00nk3r/NFL-Big-Data-Bowl-2025/\">here</a>**.\n",

    "# Model\n",
    "\n",
    "## Model selection\n",
    "\n",
    "Our tracking data consists of the sequence of coordinates for each player. It would be hard to perform clustering right the way from these sequences, that's why we needed a way to convert it to some other representation. We decided to use LSTM encoder-decoder for it. The LSTM encoder can process input trajectories, encoding them into fixed-length latent representations that encapsulate the underlying movement patterns. The decoder then attempts to reconstruct the original trajectories from these latent vectors, ensuring the encoded representations retain essential information. Then we use encoder model to create the latent vector for each trajectory. These vectors can then be used for clustering.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Feature selection and engineering for model training\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to keep only essential feautures for the model training. Here are the features that were left for the training:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. X coordinate\n",
    "2. Y coordinate\n",
    "3. Speed\n",
    "4. Acceleration\n",
    "5. Sin of direction\n",
    "6. Cos of direction\n",
    "\n",
    "Features 1-4 are just basic features, representing position and movement of a player. Then the direction angle was converted into two features: sin and cos of an angle. The reason behind it is that regular direction values have circular structure. For example, 359 is much closer to 0 than to 270. Using sin and cos instead will take care of this problem. We can think of these values as of coordinates on a unit circle, and so the same values over the different iteration on the circle (0 and 360, for example) will have the same coordinates (sin and cos values).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Model performance\n",
    "\n",
    "After training we have achieved the validation MSE of 0.063 and testing MSE of 0.064, which is pretty good result for such a complex task. This means that our model is capable of representing trajectories as latent vectors, which we can use for clustering.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Clustering\n",
    "\n",
    "After we have compressed our trajectories into vector representaion, we can perform clustering. The clustering model that was chosen is Gaussian Mixture Model. The reason why we decided to use this model is that it is capable of capturing distributions of movement data, providing a more flexible and probabilistic framework compared to the rigid cluster shapes of k-means, for example.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Number of clusters\n",
    "\n",
    "Determining the number of cluster is often not a trivial task. In our case, we decided to look at the **<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_information_criterion\">Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC)</a>** score across different number of clusters. The model that achieves the lowest value is a good candidate to be the optimal model. Here is the result we've got for number of clusters between 1 and 20:\n",

    "<center>Figure 1. BIC scores accros different numbers of clusters.</center>\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on these scores, the optimal number of clusters should be somewhere between 10 and 15. We decided to stick with 12.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Looking at the results\n",
    "\n",
    "It's finally time to look at the results of clustering. Below are the plots of all the trajectories within each cluster with the mean trajectory highlighted.\n",
    "\n",
    "<center><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/b00nk3r/NFL-Big-Data-Bowl-2025/main/code/figures/clusters_with_mean_trajectories.png\" width=\"800\"/></center>\n",
    "<center>Figure 2. All clusters with mean trajectory highlighted.</center>\n",
    "\n",
    "So, we've got 12 distinct clusters of the pre-snap motions. Notice that some clusters are symmetrical and in this case mean trajectory doesn't really represent the cluster. But overall, we have a good representation of clusters."
